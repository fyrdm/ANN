# ANN
A Simple Artificial Neural Network Implementations and Visualization


Project Properties :
1 - in C++ .Net Language
2 - A Windows Form Application
3 - Assuming that the classification is based on 2D Feature Space, i.e samples are ordered pairs (x,y) that x and y refers to features
4 - Fully Connected Neuron Layers which includes Input Layer, Hidden Layer and Output Layer
5 - Perceptron Learning Rule and Delta Learning Rule implementations
6 - Stochastic Gradient Method
7 - Error Back Propagation
